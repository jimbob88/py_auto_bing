# py_auto_bing
`py_auto_bing` is a project that automatically completes the bing rewards daily searches, it currently does not complete challenges.

But why choose `py_auto_bing` over something like [this project](https://github.com/JeffHenry/Bing-Search-Bot)?
Well this project uses the latest version of python, and also works with the latest version of Bing (i.e. it still bypasses any filtration system), it also isn't limited by a set number of search terms by using [YouTube Trending](https://www.youtube.com/feed/trending), and scraping the results into a list.

If this software ever stops working feel free to drop me an [issue](https://github.com/jimbob88/py_auto_bing/issues) or an [email](https://github.com/jimbob88).
